# Pairrogrammer: Collaborator Matching App for CS Students

Welcome to the **Pairrogrammer** repository! This project is designed to help computer science students find the perfect collaborators for their projects based on shared skills, interests, and goals. With AI-powered recommendations, skill-based matchmaking, and gamification, **Pairrogrammer** aims to enhance collaboration within the CS community.

## Documentation

The documentation for the project can be found at [docs](https://soham901.github.io/pairrogrammer).

## Project Overview

Pairrogrammer connects students, helps them find ideal project collaborators, and supports skill-based matchmaking to maximize project success. The app is built with a mobile-first approach, leveraging Flutter for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and Hono for handling requests and integrating machine learning models.

### Key Features:

- **Skill-based matchmaking**: Find the best collaborators based on your skills and preferences.
- **Project collaboration**: Create and join projects with users who complement your strengths.
- **Gamification**: Earn points, badges, and climb up the leaderboard for contributions.
- **AI-powered recommendations**: Get personalized suggestions for projects and collaborators.
- **Mobile-first design**: A responsive, engaging experience built with Flutter.

## Branches

The project is organized into several branches, each serving a specific purpose:

- **`main`**: Contains the primary documentation and serves as the central reference point for the entire project.
- **`docs`**: Contains all the project documentation (features, tech stack, contribution guidelines, etc.).
- **`mobile`**: Contains the code for the Flutter-based mobile app. This is where all frontend development happens.
- **`backend`**: Contains the code for the backend APIs built with FastAPI and Hono, including the user management, matchmaking logic, and project collaboration features.
- **`ai`**: Contains machine learning models and algorithms that power the skill-based matchmaking and project recommendations.
