## Team Collaboration

While each team member specializes in a different area, we collaborate closely to build a seamless and user-friendly product. Regular team meetings ensure that all aspects of the project—backend, frontend, AI, and UI—are well-coordinated.

### Key Collaborative Features:

- **Matching Algorithm**: While Model Monk works on the AI models, Pixel Pirate and Stack Sultan collaborate on designing the user flow and integrating the algorithm into the app.
- **Gamification**: Pixel Pirate designs the gamified UI elements, while Stack Sultan builds the API endpoints to track user progress and interactions.
- **App Integrations**: All team members work together to ensure smooth integration between the app’s frontend, backend, and ML-powered features.
